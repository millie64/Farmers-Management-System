**Farmers Management System **

Hi , my name is Milly and this is my very first full project — I’m calling it my *proof of growth*. It’s a simple CLI-based system built in Python and MySQL where farmers and suppliers can register their details.

I’m keeping this project real, vulnerable, and a bit naive — because that’s where I am right now. I’m still learning, still googling, still asking questions that sound basic, and still figuring it out — and I want to look back at this and be proud of how far I’ve come.

**What This Project Does**

This CLI-based Farmers Management System allows:
- Farmers to register their personal details
- Suppliers to do the same
- Info to be stored securely in a MySQL database
- (More features are on the way, like image uploading, live camera support, and login/signup logic)

I’m taking it one table at a time, one feature at a time — letting each step leave a stain on my brain* 

**Tech Stack**
- Python
- MySQL
- bcrypt (for password hashing)
- OpenCV (soon! for image capture)
- Git/GitHub (to version & track my growth)

**Why I'm Building This**

This is more than code. It’s about reminding myself that I can learn anything. That I’m capable. That I don’t need to be perfect to start — I just need to start.

I’ve cried while building this, doubted myself, but also smiled at the screen and whispered “I did that.” I’m going to keep learning, keep failing forward, and keep showing up until I know this tech stuff inside out.

**Next Steps (What I’ll Add)**

- Login & Signup functionality (using CLI for now)
- Farmer photo upload (for sick crops/plants)
- AI integration (to detect plant diseases)
- Vet contact system
- Cleaner file structure & error handling
**The Vision**

One day, I want this to help real farmers. I want this to connect them to help when they need it. I want this to become a system that solves real problems. Right now, it’s small — but it’s mine, and I’m proud.
